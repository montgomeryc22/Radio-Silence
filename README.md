# Radio-Silence

This project is intedned to test my computational skills and knowledge that I have acquired over my time at Allegheny College.
In addition, it will challenge my comprehension with using electronic art based computer programs within Adobe Suite (representing art and film),
FL Studio and Medley (for music composition), and Unity for both technical and artistic aspects to compile into an aggregate product that showcases
the collaboration between the two: a video game.

However, due to the time constraints of this project, the finished outcome will be a completed video game demo that will act as a catalyst for my
research of the topic in the future and possible continuation of the video game as a whole.
